# Bank Tech Test in Ruby
Coding mini-project designed to demonstrate strong processes at work; Test-Drive-Development, Object-Oriented-Programming, good commits and documentation.

## Overview

### Requirements

- You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL (in this case IRB). You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.
- Deposits, withdrawal.
- Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
- Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).
